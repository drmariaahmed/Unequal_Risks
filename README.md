## Project Description

This study investigates racial and class disparities in Caesarean-section (C-section) procedures using 2023 U.S. Natality data. The analysis uses a chain-of-risks modeling strategy and risk-stratified analyses distinguishing between lower-risk births (LRB) and higher-risk births (HRB) to examine how disparities persist even after accounting for behavioral clinical risk profiles.

## Reproducibility

To replicate the analysis:

1. Download the [2023 Natality dataset](https://www.nber.org/research/data/vital-statistics-natality-birth-data)
2. Place the raw file in: `Unequal_Risks/data/natality2023us.dta`
3. Open Stata (version 18+), set your working directory to the root folder:
   ```stata
   cd "your/local/path/Unequal_Risks"
   ```
4. Run the scripts in order:
   - `01_cleaning.do`
   - `02_filter.do`
   - `03_dtable_colperc.do`
   - `04_dtable_rowperc.do`
   - `05_CoR_models.do`
   - `06_LRB_HRB_models.do`
   - `07_LRB_HRB_PP_AME.do`
